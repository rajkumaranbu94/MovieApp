**Project Overview
**

This app allows users to search for movies by title. When a user enters a search term, the app will fetch results from the OMDb API and display a list of movies with their title, release year, and poster image. The app should provide a seamless and user-friendly experience, ensuring smooth navigation, responsiveness, and clarity.

**Architecture and Design Patterns**

For a maintainable, scalable app, we can adopt popular design patterns and architecture principles:

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):

Model: Represents the data structure (movie details, such as title, year, and poster).

View: The UI components (e.g., RecyclerView for Android) that display the data.

ViewModel: Acts as the intermediary between the view and the model, handling data fetching and transformation.

**Repository Pattern:**

To manage data sources efficiently, use the Repository Pattern. The repository will act as a single source of truth, managing both remote (API) and local data storage (if applicable).

**Networking:**

Retrofit (Android) for network requests.
Handle API responses with Coroutine (Android) to maintain a responsive UI.

**Tools and Technologies:**

Frontend:

Android: Kotlin, Android Studio, RecyclerView (for displaying the list), Retrofit (networking), Glide(for loading images)

Backend:

API: OMDb API (GET request to https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=[movie title]&apikey=8d6aa4ca)

Version Control:

Git for version control and collaboration.

**Key Features & UX Considerations**

Search Bar:

A search bar at the top of the screen where users can type movie titles. As they type, suggestions can be shown (depending on API capabilities).
Use a debounce function to avoid excessive API calls during each keystroke.

Display Movie Results:

Each result should have the movieâ€™s title, release year, and poster image.
Use an ImageView in Android or an UIImageView in iOS to display the movie poster, ensuring images are loaded asynchronously using a caching library like Glide (Android) or SDWebImage (iOS).

Error Handling:

If the API request fails (e.g., no internet, invalid search, No movie data), display a Toast (Android) with an error message.
Also, show an appropriate message if no results are found.

Loading State:

Show a loading indicator (e.g., an animated movie widget spinner) while the app is fetching data.
Hide the loading indicator once the data is successfully fetched.
